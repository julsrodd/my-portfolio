      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Current cloud storage services don’t offer a seamless or intuitive user
      <br> experience. Non-tech users are not considered, which results in hesitation
      <br> in using cloud storage services. Cloud storage solutions fail to reach
      <br> their full potential by not looking deeper into their capabilities and
      <br> exploring features like collaboration, link storage, organization, and
      <br> customization that optimize the collaborative process.
      <hr class="section-divider">

    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <img class="mockup" src="images/billow-mockup.png" alt="Billow Mockup 2" ></a>
      <p>Billow is a cloud storage service that offers users the ability to
      <br> customize content organization by providing an initial folder setup
        <br> based on their needs as individuals, freelancers, or business teams. Users
        <br> are also able to create content like documents, sheets and notes, organize
        <br> content, uploading files as well as sharing and collaborating in real-time. These
        <br> solutions reduce the drag for users of having to figure out how to organize
        <br> their files and content as well as reducing the amount of external communication
        <br> with real-time collaboration tools.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>User Survey</h3>
      <img class="insights" src="images/billow-insights.png" alt="Billow Insights" ></a>
      <p>The solutions I came up with are based on the insights gathered on the
      <br> user surveys where I learned if participants use or don’t use cloud storage,
      <br> why to use it, what their frustrations, which features they prioritize
      <br> are and what would motivate them to use it.
      <br>
      <br>The survey was completed by 19 participants.

      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>Based on the user surveys, I was able to identify two types of users;
      <br>the non-user who’s hesitant about using cloud storage because it seems
      <br>overwhelming and the active user who is interested in trying out a new
      <br>service that meets her needs.

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>User Flows & User Stories </h3>
      <p>For the user stories, I focused on what survey participants and personas
      <br>prioritized. I compiled a list of high and medium priorities to reach
      <br>the minimum viable product. Based on the user stories, I created user
      <br>flows to show how users will complete these tasks.

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <img class="competitor" src="images/airtable.png" alt="Airtable Logo" ><
      <img class="competitor" src="images/googledrive.png" alt="Google Drive Logo" >
      <img class="competitor" src="images/evernote.png" alt="Evernote" >
      <p>After completing this analysis, I realized that each of these apps has different advantages according
        <br> to the user’s specific needs. For those looking to share files, documents, collaboration, and organizing
        <br> all of these contents, google drive seems to be at the top. For users looking for more of a project management
        <br> tool that includes collaboration Airtable might be the best option. Lastly, for those wanting to store, share,
        <br> and organize notes, Evernote is a good option. All of these competitors have vital offerings and benefits, with
        <br> Google Drive being the closest as far as crucial features the client provided on the brief. This new product has
        <br> a lot of opportunities to cover user's needs and concerns that these competitors don’t offer like storage space,
        <br> file organization, collaboration and sharing options, security, and creating documents.

    <p>
    <br> In this phase, I gathered all insights from research and surveys to go back to the drawing board. It
    <br> was clear that I needed to create a navigation that was easy to use for active users and non-users
    <br> who might not be as tech-savvy or might feel overwhelmed with trying new systems.

  <h3>Usability Testing Round 1</h3>
  <p>This is where the iteration process began, the following are the key takeaways from this round:</p>
  <p>- Main CTA on homepage must be revised it should probably make reference to each of the
  <br>  membership tiers or to “learn more” or even “sign up now” so that users are not confused
  <br>  or resist signing up because they assume they will be charged</p>
<p>- Revise the wording on the upload window’s CTA it can say upload rather than open to avoid
  <br>confusion</p>
  <p>- Adding file/folder information on the dashboard (list view) as suggested by Manuel</p>

  <h2>Designing the logo to evoke a feeling of Ease </h2>
  <h3>The brand</h3>
  <p>The brand name stands to represent a cloud but also how this service flows for users as far as it’s features of
  <br>  creating, collaborating and sharing. The brand will be simple, light, somewhat playful and relatable. It will
  <br>  also give users a  sense of effortlessness. I chose this direction so it appeals to all kinds of users (individuals
  <br>  and teams) that will be using the product while keeping in mind that some can find cloud storage services confusing.

  <h3>Color Palette & Style Guide</h3>
  <p>Based on the mood, the brand assets where created. The logo
  <br>  icon is a reinterpretation of a cloud to continue to evoke that
  <br>  feeling of calmness and simplicity. For the logo, I chose a gradient
  <br>  using the lighter blue to light pink. This same gradient is used subtly
  <br>  in some elements like icons and banners. The main accent color is the
  <br>  darker blue which creates balance and harmony with the rest of the shades.</p>

  <h2>Hi-Fi MockuPS</h2>
  <p>Following the branding, requirements and user flows,
  <br>  wireframes transformed into hi-fi mockups focused on the
  <br>  desktop experience. I considered user feedback and design
  <br>  patterns as well to create an interface that was easy to use for
  <br>  both tiers of user personas.
</p>
  <a href="#">See Mockups</a>
  <h3>Usability testing 2.0</h3>
  <p>After implementing the branding and initial changes based on the
  <br>  first round of user testing and adding the branding, I focused this
  <br>  test on similar tasks to make sure that users understand and are
  <br>  able to use the app seamlessly.</p>
  <p>Key takeaways:</p>
  <p>- Change colors on bottom CTA on the homepage so they are easier
  <br>to read</p>
  <p>- Add icons or some text on the first enrollment screen so that users
    <br> understand what choosing a free account versus a paid one entails.</p>
  <p>- Adding the option to see “date created” on the list view of the
    <br>dashboard</p>
  <p>- Revise link sharing options on sharing screen

  <h2>Preference testing</h2>
  <p>After receiving feedback from user testing interviews, I ran a preference test to get
  <br>even more clarity around specific items of the user interface.</p>

  <h2>The final result</h2>
  <p>After a few rounds of revisions based on results from user testing, I finalized the cloud service.
    <br>Minor tweaks were implemented in this round according to the user’s feedback.

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Creating this application taught me the importance of testing and prioritizing user’s needs and feedback
  <br> rather than relying on intuition. This lesson came across multiple times in the visual design phase,
  <br>preference test and last round of user testing. Aside from user feedback, I also learned the importance
  <br> of following guidelines and requirements in design as well as staying up to date when it comes to design
  <br>patterns and best practices. In the design phase, I had some doubts as far as the possibility of creating
  <br> a product that users could easily relate to and felt comfortable using. One of my biggest surprises was
  <br>definitely that even those who are hesitant or not inclined to use new technologies were able to
  <br>understand and use the app without major issues. Lastly, I learned the importance of focusing on key
  <br>screens first to ensure that the user’s frustrations and key needs are prioritized.
