      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Current cloud storage services don’t offer a seamless or intuitive user
      <br> experience. Non-tech users are not considered, which results in hesitation
      <br> in using cloud storage services. Cloud storage solutions fail to reach
      <br> their full potential by not looking deeper into their capabilities and
      <br> exploring features like collaboration, link storage, organization, and
      <br> customization that optimize the collaborative process.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <img class="mockup" src="images/billow-mockup.png" alt="Billow Mockup 2" ></a>
      <p>Billow is a cloud storage service that offers users the ability to
      <br> customize content organization by providing an initial folder setup
        <br> based on their needs as individuals, freelancers, or business teams. Users
        <br> are also able to create content like documents, sheets and notes, organize
        <br> content, uploading files as well as sharing and collaborating in real-time. These
        <br> solutions reduce the drag for users of having to figure out how to organize
        <br> their files and content as well as reducing the amount of external communication
        <br> with real-time collaboration tools.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>User Survey</h3>
      <p>The solutions I came up with are based on the insights gathered on the
      <br> user surveys where I learned if participants use or don’t use cloud storage,
      <br> why to use it, what their frustrations, which features they prioritize
      <br> are and what would motivate them to use it.
      <br>
      <br>The survey was completed by 19 participants.
