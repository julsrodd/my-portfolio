      <h2>Problem</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="p2-container">
      <p>Current cloud storage services don’t offer a seamless or intuitive user
      experience. Non-tech users are not considered, which results in hesitation
      in using cloud storage services. Cloud storage solutions fail to reach
      their full potential by not looking deeper into their capabilities and
      exploring features like collaboration, link storage, organization, and
      customization that optimize the collaborative process.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <img class="mockup" src="images/billow-mockup.png" alt="Billow Mockup 2" ></a>
      <div class= "solution-p"
      <p>Billow is a cloud storage service that offers users the ability to
      customize content organization by providing an initial folder setup
      based on their needs as individuals, freelancers, or business teams. Users
      are also able to create content like documents, sheets and notes, organize
      content, uploading files as well as sharing and collaborating in real-time. These
      solutions reduce the drag for users of having to figure out how to organize
      their files and content as well as reducing the amount of external communication
       with real-time collaboration tools.

        <h3>User Survey</h3>
        <p>The solutions I came up with are based on the insights gathered on the
        user surveys where I learned if participants use or don’t use cloud storage,
        why to use it, what their frustrations, which features they prioritize
        are and what would motivate them to use it.
        The survey was completed by 19 participants.</p>

      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>Based on the user surveys, I was able to identify two types of users;
      the non-user who’s hesitant about using cloud storage because it seems
      overwhelming and the active user who is interested in trying out a new
      service that meets her needs.

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>User Flows & User Stories </h3>
    <p> For the user stories, I focused on what survey participants and personas
      prioritized. I compiled a list of high and medium priorities to reach
      the minimum viable product. Based on the user stories, I created user
      flows to show how users will complete these tasks. </p>

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <img class="competitor" src="images/airtable.png" alt="Airtable Logo" >
      <img class="competitor" src="images/googledrive.png" alt="Google Drive Logo" >
      <img class="competitor" src="images/evernote.png" alt="Evernote" >
      <p>After completing this analysis, I realized that each of these apps has different advantages according
        to the user’s specific needs. For those looking to share files, documents, collaboration, and organizing
        all of these contents, google drive seems to be at the top. For users looking for more of a project management
        tool that includes collaboration Airtable might be the best option. Lastly, for those wanting to store, share,
        and organize notes, Evernote is a good option. All of these competitors have vital offerings and benefits, with
        Google Drive being the closest as far as crucial features the client provided on the brief. This new product has
        a lot of opportunities to cover user's needs and concerns that these competitors don’t offer like storage space,
        file organization, collaboration and sharing options, security, and creating documents.

    <p>
    In this phase, I gathered all insights from research and surveys to go back to the drawing board. It
    was clear that I needed to create a navigation that was easy to use for active users and non-users
    who might not be as tech-savvy or might feel overwhelmed with trying new systems.

  <h3>Usability Testing Round 1</h3>
  <p>This is where the iteration process began, the following are the key takeaways from this round:</p>
  <p>- Main CTA on homepage must be revised it should probably make reference to each of the
  membership tiers or to “learn more” or even “sign up now” so that users are not confused
   or resist signing up because they assume they will be charged</p>
<p>- Revise the wording on the upload window’s CTA it can say upload rather than open to avoid
  confusion</p>
  <p>- Adding file/folder information on the dashboard (list view) as suggested by Manuel</p>

  <h2>Designing the logo to evoke a feeling of Ease </h2>
  <h3>The brand</h3>
  <p>The brand name stands to represent a cloud but also how this service flows for users as far as it’s features of
   creating, collaborating and sharing. The brand will be simple, light, somewhat playful and relatable. It will
   also give users a  sense of effortlessness. I chose this direction so it appeals to all kinds of users (individuals
   and teams) that will be using the product while keeping in mind that some can find cloud storage services confusing.

  <h3>Color Palette & Style Guide</h3>
  <p>Based on the mood, the brand assets where created. The logo
   icon is a reinterpretation of a cloud to continue to evoke that
   feeling of calmness and simplicity. For the logo, I chose a gradient
   using the lighter blue to light pink. This same gradient is used subtly
   in some elements like icons and banners. The main accent color is the
   darker blue which creates balance and harmony with the rest of the shades.</p>

  <h2>Hi-Fi MockuPS</h2>
  <p>Following the branding, requirements and user flows,
   wireframes transformed into hi-fi mockups focused on the
   desktop experience. I considered user feedback and design
   patterns as well to create an interface that was easy to use for
   both tiers of user personas.

<h3>Usability testing 2.0</h3>
<p>After implementing the branding and initial changes based on the
 first round of user testing and adding the branding, I focused this
 test on similar tasks to make sure that users understand and are
 able to use the app seamlessly.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>- Change colors on bottom CTA on the homepage so they are easier
to read</p>
<p>- Add icons or some text on the first enrollment screen so that users
understand what choosing a free account versus a paid one entails.</p>
<p>- Adding the option to see “date created” on the list view of the
dashboard</p>
<p>- Revise link sharing options on sharing screen

  <h2>The final result</h2>
  <p>After a few rounds of revisions based on results from user testing, I finalized the cloud service.
    <br>Minor tweaks were implemented in this round according to the user’s feedback.

  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Creating this application taught me the importance of testing and prioritizing user’s needs and feedback
   rather than relying on intuition. This lesson came across multiple times in the visual design phase,
  preference test and last round of user testing. Aside from user feedback, I also learned the importance
  of following guidelines and requirements in design as well as staying up to date when it comes to design
  patterns and best practices. In the design phase, I had some doubts as far as the possibility of creating
  a product that users could easily relate to and felt comfortable using. One of my biggest surprises was
  definitely that even those who are hesitant or not inclined to use new technologies were able to
  understand and use the app without major issues. Lastly, I learned the importance of focusing on key
  screens first to ensure that the user’s frustrations and key needs are prioritized.
