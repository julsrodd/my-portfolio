      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Current cloud storage services don’t offer a seamless or intuitive user
      <br> experience. Non-tech users are not considered, which results in hesitation
      <br> in using cloud storage services. Cloud storage solutions fail to reach
      <br> their full potential by not looking deeper into their capabilities and
      <br> exploring features like collaboration, link storage, organization, and
      <br> customization that optimize the collaborative process.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <img class="mockup" src="images/billow-mockup.png" alt="Billow Mockup 2" ></a>
      <p>Billow is a cloud storage service that offers users the ability to
      <br> customize content organization by providing an initial folder setup
        <br> based on their needs as individuals, freelancers, or business teams. Users
        <br> are also able to create content like documents, sheets and notes, organize
        <br> content, uploading files as well as sharing and collaborating in real-time. These
        <br> solutions reduce the drag for users of having to figure out how to organize
        <br> their files and content as well as reducing the amount of external communication
        <br> with real-time collaboration tools.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <h3>User Survey</h3>
      <img class="insights" src="images/billow-insights.png" alt="Billow Insights" ></a>
      <p>The solutions I came up with are based on the insights gathered on the
      <br> user surveys where I learned if participants use or don’t use cloud storage,
      <br> why to use it, what their frustrations, which features they prioritize
      <br> are and what would motivate them to use it.
      <br>
      <br>The survey was completed by 19 participants.

      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>Based on the user surveys, I was able to identify two types of users;
      <br>the non-user who’s hesitant about using cloud storage because it seems
      <br>overwhelming and the active user who is interested in trying out a new
      <br>service that meets her needs.

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <h3>User Flows & User Stories </h3>
      <p>For the user stories, I focused on what survey participants and personas
      <br>prioritized. I compiled a list of high and medium priorities to reach
      <br>the minimum viable product. Based on the user stories, I created user
      <br>flows to show how users will complete these tasks.
    <br>
  <table>
  <tr>
  <th>User Type</th>
  <th>Action</th>
  <th>Priority</th>

      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>After completing this analysis, I realized that each of these apps has different advantages according
         to the user’s specific needs. For those looking to share files, documents, collaboration, and organizing
         all of these contents, google drive seems to be at the top. For users looking for more of a project management
         tool that includes collaboration Airtable might be the best option. Lastly, for those wanting to store, share,
         and organize notes, Evernote is a good option. All of these competitors have vital offerings and benefits, with
         Google Drive being the closest as far as crucial features the client provided on the brief. This new product has
         a lot of opportunities to cover user's needs and concerns that these competitors don’t offer like storage space,
         file organization, collaboration and sharing options, security, and creating documents.
