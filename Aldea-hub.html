      <p>The Latinx community lacks representation in tech and there are very few digital communities that provide resources to advance in this sector.</p>

        <p>Aldea Hub; an online community and platform on a mission to help the Latinx community thrive in tech by offering resources, mentorship, and job opportunities.

        <h3>User Survey</h3>
        <p>The results for the survey further validate the assumption that there is a big need for a platform that helps the Latinx community thrive in tech. It’s interesting to see the importance of Latinx students to have access to entry-level and internship opportunities. This survey informs how to proceed when it comes to the main focus of the platform, which is clear that it would be providing access to careers and community. I'm curious to see the results, once interviews are done, about the specific topics of interest within the resources.

    </div>
      <p>Each of these apps has different advantages according to what the community would need. When it comes to the Latinx community in tech, Techqueria seems to be superior because of their offerings and focus on the Latinx community. If the user is looking for a design-centric community, Latinxs Who Design seems like the best choice. Lastly, Diversify Tech has a broader approach since they cater to underrepresented communities in general, with a big focus on development. The results of this analysis prove that there is an opportunity for a new platform focused that covers the community needs for Latinx in tech.

      In this phase, I gathered all insights from research and surveys and went  back to the drawing board.

The biggest challenge was creating the member dashboard and making sure that all the resource categories and job board where presented in a clear and concise way.

The brand is vibrant, fun, and inclusive, so for the color palette, I used a bright blue followed by accents of orange, bright pink and turquoise for icons, borders, and highlights. A lighter grey was added later on for balance and contrast.

  <!--   <h3>Usability Testing Round 1</h3>
  <p>This is where the iteration process began, the following are the key takeaways from this round:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Main CTA on homepage must be revised it should probably make reference to each of the
    membership tiers or to “learn more” or even “sign up now” so that users are not confused
     or resist signing up because they assume they will be charged</li>
     <li>Revise the wording on the upload window’s CTA it can say upload rather than open to avoid
       confusion</li>
       <li>Adding file/folder information on the dashboard (list view) as suggested by Manuel</li>
  </ul> -->

  <h2>The Prototype</h2>
  <p>Once the mockups were created and feedback was provided, I created the prototype for user testing . During the creation of the prototype, I realized some menu items had been missing and added additional screens on the job submissions user flow be self explanatory.

  <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
  <p>This is where the iteration process focused on user feedback began.
</p>
  <p>Key takeaways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add additional filter on job search for salary</li>
   <li>Adding “clues” on the main page about the importance/relevance of the resources available
</li>
 </ul>

<section class="result">
  <h2>The final result</h2>
  <p>The process of creating this platform was very informative and insightful. As a Latinx myself, I’ve always felt we are underrepresented in the tech sector. But once the research process started, it made me realize that the options available in Latinx digital communities are very limited. Not all options available offer a full spectrum of resources and support which came across during the user research as well. If I had more time, I would have created more screens for other tasks. I intend to continue the iteration process after launching, so this will allow me to keep adding features, running user tests and finding solutions to user’s concerns about access within the tech sector.

<section class="b-improv">
  <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
If I had more time, I would integrate additional key features  like  notes, spreadsheets
nd adding tags to allow users to create more types of content quickly, engage even further
with their teams or clients. I would also work on filtering and sorting options for the dashboard
as well as integrations (Design Tools, Project Management, Calendars) so that users have flexibility in their process.
