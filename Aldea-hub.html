        <p>The results for the survey further validate the assumption that there is a big need for a platform that helps the Latinx community thrive in tech. It’s interesting to see the importance of Latinx students to have access to entry-level and internship opportunities. This survey informs how to proceed when it comes to the main focus of the platform, which is clear that it would be providing access to careers and community. I'm curious to see the results, once interviews are done, about the specific topics of interest within the resources.

      <p>Each of these apps has different advantages according to what the community would need. When it comes to the Latinx community in tech, Techqueria seems to be superior because of their offerings and focus on the Latinx community. If the user is looking for a design-centric community, Latinxs Who Design seems like the best choice. Lastly, Diversify Tech has a broader approach since they cater to underrepresented communities in general, with a big focus on development. The results of this analysis prove that there is an opportunity for a new platform focused that covers the community needs for Latinx in tech.

      In this phase, I gathered all insights from research and surveys and went  back to the drawing board. I focused on what the tasks users prioritized and created initial sketches based on these findings. The biggest challenge was creating the member dashboard and making sure that all the resource categories and job board where presented in a clear and concise way.

The brand is vibrant, fun, and inclusive, so for the color palette, I used a bright blue followed by accents of orange, bright pink and turquoise for icons, borders, and highlights. A lighter grey was added later on for balance and contrast.

Following the branding, requirements and user flows, wireframes transformed into hi-fi mockups, focused on the desktop experience. Creating the mockups allowed me to identify the important aspects of the project that can then be tested to determine the MVP and will allow me to organize the deliverables and expectations.

  <h3>Usability Testing Round 1</h3>
  <p>This is where the iteration process began, the following are the key takeaways from this round:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Main CTA on homepage must be revised it should probably make reference to each of the
    membership tiers or to “learn more” or even “sign up now” so that users are not confused
     or resist signing up because they assume they will be charged</li>
     <li>Revise the wording on the upload window’s CTA it can say upload rather than open to avoid
       confusion</li>
       <li>Adding file/folder information on the dashboard (list view) as suggested by Manuel</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="hf-mock1">
  <h2>The Prototype</h2>
  <p>Once the mockups were created and feedback was provided, I created the prototype for user testing . During the creation of the prototype, I realized some menu items had been missing and added additional screens on the job submissions user flow be self explanatory.

  <h3>Usability testing 2.0</h3>
  <p>After implementing the branding and initial changes based on the
   first round of user testing and adding the branding, I focused this
   test on similar tasks to make sure that users understand and are
   able to use the app seamlessly.</p>
  <p>Key takeaways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change colors on bottom CTA on the homepage so they are easier
     to read</li>
   <li>Add icons or some text on the first enrollment screen so that users
   understand what choosing a free account versus a paid one entails.</li>
   <li>Adding the option to see “date created” on the list view of the
   dashboard</li>
   <li>Revise link sharing options on sharing screen</li>
 </ul>

  <h2>The final result</h2>
  <p>After a few rounds of revisions based on results from user testing, I finalized the cloud service.
  Minor tweaks were implemented in this round according to the user’s feedback.

<a href="https://invis.io/V5V9M8AMKZ9">Check out the prototype</a>
<br>
  <h3>Takeaways</h3>
  <p>Creating this application taught me the importance of testing and prioritizing user’s needs and feedback
   rather than relying on intuition. This lesson came across multiple times in the visual design phase,
  preference test and last round of user testing. Aside from user feedback, I also learned the importance
  of following guidelines and requirements in design as well as staying up to date when it comes to design
  patterns and best practices. In the design phase, I had some doubts as far as the possibility of creating
  a product that users could easily relate to and felt comfortable using. One of my biggest surprises was
  definitely that even those who are hesitant or not inclined to use new technologies were able to
  understand and use the app without major issues. Lastly, I learned the importance of focusing on key
  screens first to ensure that the user’s frustrations and key needs are prioritized.
</p>

<section class="b-improv">
  <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
If I had more time, I would integrate additional key features  like  notes, spreadsheets
nd adding tags to allow users to create more types of content quickly, engage even further
with their teams or clients. I would also work on filtering and sorting options for the dashboard
as well as integrations (Design Tools, Project Management, Calendars) so that users have flexibility in their process.
