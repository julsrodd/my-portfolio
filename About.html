    <h2> THE JOURNEY </h2>
    <p> My design career is rooted in curiosity. As a child, I was always interested in
      <br> the why of things and solving problems so when we got our first computer
      <br> at home, I immersed myself in learning it's functionality to the point that I was
      <br> the go-to for my parents and family when it came to setting up and using
      <br> computers. Back in 9th grade (the early 2000s), I had to create a flyer for a
      <br> fake play, I had no idea what photoshop was at this point, so I played around
      <br> with Microsoft Word and created a flyer that did the job. My teacher was impressed,
      <br> and the work was presented at a college conference, she s
      <br> uggested I pursued a career in graphic design or advertising. </p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p> In college, I pursued a degree in Advertising, where I took some design
        <br> classes, but I still felt out of place, and my work was not pixel perfect. After
        <br> graduating, I took a job at an apparel company where I learned the in's and
        <br> out's of developing a product. A few years later, and started working at a
        <br> start-up involved in digital media as a social media manager. Even though my
        <br> role didn't include creating actual designs myself, I was involved in the design
        <br>process, and I felt like I was getting closer to where I wanted to be in my
        <br>career.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> <blockquote> A year later, I moved to New York and continued to
        <br>work in digital marketing at a shopping app where I
        <br>had my first interaction with UX design. This is where I
        <br>had my "AHA!" moment and realized that it was
        <br>possible to create digital solutions that were not only
        <br>appealing but that actually met user's needs. This
        <br>sparked my curiosity as far as what I needed to do to
        <br>get there and if it would be possible for me to start a
        <br>career in UX. </blockquote>
        <br>

<p> Simultaneously, I was taking on freelance projects related to social media,
  <br>where I also took on the role of web designer at times so I could execute
  <br>campaigns without depending on a web designer. I realized in the process that
  <br>web design was not going in-depth when it came to empathize with the users
  <br>and the process couldn't come down to using a template or a framework to
  <br>present a product, there had to be more there. So the quest for a UX design
  <br>program began.
</p>
  <br>
  <br>
<h3> WHY UX?</h3>
<p> UX design is the perfect combination of my passion for solving problems
  <br>and my ability to empathize with people. I was 100% committed to making
  <br>this transition, and I enrolled in Bloc.io's UX Design Apprenticeship, where I
  <br>was mentored by Becky Olsen. Through the program and Becky's guidance,
  <br>learned the importance of solving problems based on user's needs and use
  <br>the skills I had gained from digital marketing to create user-centered
  <br>products. Being in New York helped me understand the lack of
  <br>representation in tech for women and the Latin community, and one of my
  <br>biggest passions is creating the tools and resources that can help these
  <br>communities thrive in this space.
