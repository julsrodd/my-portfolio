    <h2\> THE JOURNEY </h2>
    <p> My design career is rooted in curiosity. As a child, I was always interested in
      the why of things and solving problems so when we got our first computer
      at home, I immersed myself in learning it's functionality to the point that I was
      the go-to for my parents and family when it came to setting up and using
      computers. Back in 9th grade (the early 2000s), I had to create a flyer for a
      fake play, I had no idea what photoshop was at this point, so I played around
      with Microsoft Word and created a flyer that did the job. My teacher was impressed,
      and the work was presented at a college conference, she suggested I pursued a
      career in graphic design or advertising. </p>

      <p> In college, I pursued a degree in Advertising, where I took some design
        classes, but I still felt out of place, and my work was not pixel perfect. After
        graduating, I took a job at an apparel company where I learned the in's and
        out's of developing a product. A few years later, and started working at a
        start-up involved in digital media as a social media manager. Even though my
        role didn't include creating actual designs myself, I was involved in the design
        process, and I felt like I was getting closer to where I wanted to be in my
        career.

         <blockquote> A year later, I moved to New York and continued to
        work in digital marketing at a shopping app where I
        had my first interaction with UX design. This is where I
        had my "AHA!" moment and realized that it was
        possible to create digital solutions that were not only
        appealing but that actually met user's needs. This
        sparked my curiosity as far as what I needed to do to
        get there and if it would be possible for me to start a
        career in UX. </blockquote>

<p> Simultaneously, I was taking on freelance projects related to social media,
  where I also took on the role of web designer at times so I could execute
  campaigns without depending on a web designer. I realized in the process that
  web design was not going in-depth when it came to empathize with the users
  and the process couldn't come down to using a template or a framework to
  present a product, there had to be more there. So the quest for a UX design
  program began.
</p>
<br>
<h3> WHY UX?</h3>
<p> UX design is the perfect combination of my passion for solving problems
  and my ability to empathize with people. I was 100% committed to making
  this transition, and I enrolled in Bloc.io's UX Design Apprenticeship, where I
  was mentored by Becky Olsen. Through the program and Becky's guidance,
  learned the importance of solving problems based on user's needs and use
  the skills I had gained from digital marketing to create user-centered
  products. Being in New York helped me understand the lack of
  representation in tech for women and the Latin community, and one of my
  biggest passions is creating the tools and resources that can help these
  communities thrive in this space.
